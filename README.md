This project is under active development.
The website of this repository is available [here](http://dev.hpcc.ucr.edu).
Which is automatically built using github actions, when the master branch receives a push.

## Highlighting

For support of additional languages or features redownload the Prism JS library and CSS from [here](https://prismjs.com/download.html#themes=prism&languages=bash+python+r&plugins=line-numbers+show-language+toolbar+copy-to-clipboard).
And then add them to the `/static` directory.
