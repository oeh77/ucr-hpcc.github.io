## Introduction
This manual provides an introduction to the usage of the HPCC cluster.
All servers and compute resources of the HPCC cluster are available to researchers from all departments and colleges at UC Riverside for a minimal recharge fee [(see rates)](/about/facility/rates).
To request an account, please email [support@hpcc.ucr.edu](mailto:support@hpcc.ucr.edu).
The latest hardware/facility description for grant applications is available [here](https://goo.gl/43eOwQ).

## Overview

### Storage
* Four enterprise class HPC storage systems
* Approximately 6 PB of total network storage (3,072 TB production and 3,072 TB backup) 
* GPFS (NFS and SAMBA via GPFS)
* Automatic snapshots and archival backups

### Network
* Ethernet
    * 1 Gb/s switch x 5
    * 1 Gb/s switch 10 Gig uplink
    * 10 Gb/s switch for Campus wide Science DMZ
    * redundant, load balanced, robust mesh topology
* Interconnect
    * 56 Gb/s InfiniBand (FDR)

### Head Nodes
All users should access the cluster via ssh through cluster.hpcc.ucr.edu, this address will automatically balance traffic to one of the available head nodes.
